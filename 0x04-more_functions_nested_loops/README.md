0. A C function that checks for uppercase character, returning 1 if c is uppercase, otherwise return 0.

1. A C function that checks for a digit (0 through 9), returning 1 if c is a digit, otherwise 0.

2. A C function that multiplies two integers.

3. A C function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

4. A C function that print the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line, excluding 2 and 4, using only _putchar twice.

5. A C function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed y a new line, using only the _putchar function three times excatly.

6. A C function that draws a straight line in the terminal, using only _putchar function to print, where n is the number of times the character _ is be printed.
   - The line should end with a \n.
   - The function only print \n, if n is 0 or less.

7. A C function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal, using only the _putchar function to print.
   - Where n is the number of times the character \ is printed.
   - The diagonal ends with a \n.
   - If n is 0 or less, the function only print a \n.

8. A C function that prints a square, followed by a new line, using only the _putchar function to print, where size is the size of the square.
   - If size is 0 or less, the function prints only a new line.
   - The character # to print the square.

9. A C program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.
   -Each number or word is separated by a space.
   - Standard library is used.

10. A C function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line, using only the _putchar function to print, where size is the size of the triangle.
   - f size is 0 or less, the function print's only a new line  
   - The Character # to print the triangle.
