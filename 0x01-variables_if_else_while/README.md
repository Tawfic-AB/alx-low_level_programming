0- A C program that assigns a random number to the variable n each time it is executed, followed by a new line.
   - A different value is stored every time the program is run.
   - Prints the number followed by is positive if the number is greater than 0, is zero if the number is zero, or is negative if the number is less t     han 0.

1- A C program that assigns a random number to the variable n each time it is executed, followed by a new line.
   - A different value is stored every time the program is run.
   - Prints the string "Last digit of n "is" last digit "and is" followed by "greater than 5" if the digit is greter then 5, "0" if the digit is 0, o     r "less then 6 and not 0" if the digit is less then 6 and not 0.

2- A C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line, using only the putchar function twice.

3- A C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line, using only the putchar function twice.

4- A C program that prints all the alphabet in lowercase except q and e, followed by a new line, using only the putchar function twice.

5- A C program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

6- A C program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line, using only the putchar function twice, and without char varibles.

7- A C program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line, using only the putchar function twice.

8- A C program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line, using only the putchar function twice.

9- A C program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers, using only the putchar function four times maximum, without any variables of type char:
   - Numbers are separated by , , followed by a space.
   - Numbers are printed in ascending order.

10- A C program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits, using only the putchar function five times maximum, witjout any variable of type char.
   - Numbers are separated by ,, followed by a space.
   - The two digits are different.
   - 01 and 10 are considered the same combination of the two digits 0 and 1.
   - Print only the smallest combination of two digits.
   - Numbers are printed in ascending order, with two digits.
   - Code is in the main function.
